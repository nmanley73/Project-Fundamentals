# Project-Fundamentals


## Instructions
In this project you must perform and explain simple linear regression using Python on the powerproduction dataset available on Moodle. The goal is to accurately predict wind turbine power output from wind speed values using the data set as a basis. To enhance your submission, you might consider comparing simple linear regression to other types of regression on this data set.
